        <h3>Chess Basics</h3>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces, including a king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.</p>

        <h3>Chess Rules</h3>
        <p>Chess rules govern the movement of each piece. Pawns move forward, bishops diagonally, knights in an 'L' shape, rooks horizontally or vertically, queens in any direction, and kings one square in any direction.</p>

        <h3>FIDE and Chess Ratings</h3>
        <p>The FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale des Ã‰checs (FIDE) is the international chess federation. FIDE assigns ratings to players based on their performance in rated games. Higher ratings indicate stronger players.</p>

        <h3>Chess Titles and Norms</h3>
        <p>FIDE awards titles such as Grandmaster (GM) and International Master (IM) to top players. Players achieve norms by meeting performance criteria in tournaments, contributing to title aspirations.</p>
